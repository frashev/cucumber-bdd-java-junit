Encapsulation: wrapping up of data under a single unit! The data is protected!

How? 
- By making class attributes (or variables) private
- By making methods as private

Use getter and setter methods to access private attributes

Advantages
----------
- Data hiding
- Flexibility to use variable as read only or write only
- Reusability
