Polymorphism: Ability of an object to take many forms!

How? By Overriding or Overloading methods.

Method Overriding
-----------------
- Allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided 
by its superclass 
- Method in subclass should have the same name, same signature, and same return type(or sub-type) 
as the method in its superclass

Method Overloading
------------------
- Allows different methods to have the same name, but different signatures where the signature 
can differ by the number of input parameters or type of input parameters or both

Polymorphism Types
------------------
- Runtime polymorphism or Dynamic method dispatch: Call resolved at runtime based on the type of the
object being referred to at the time the call occurs
E.g. Method Overriding
- Compile time polymorphism: Call resolved at compile time
E.g. Method Overloading 

Notes
-----
- final methods cannot be overridden
- Static methods cannot be overridden (method hiding)
