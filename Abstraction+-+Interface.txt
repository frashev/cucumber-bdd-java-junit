Methods are by default abstract and public
Attributes are by default public, static and final. In other words, attributes are constants
Cannot contain constructor
Must be implemented by other class using implements keyword
Sub class must implement all abstract methods
Sub class can implement multiple interfaces
Java8: Can have default method
Java8: Can have static method

Adv
---
Reduces complexity by hiding implementation
Increases security by providing only important details to the user
Helps achieve multiple inheritance

E.g.
----
Shapes: Abstract
Triangle: SubClass1
Square: SubClass2
